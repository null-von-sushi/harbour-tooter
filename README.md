# Changes in this fork compared to original

I could not get the app to work with pleroma (explosion.party instance) so I was hoping to fix it myself. Now, while I didn't really understand anything important and didn't fix it to my knowledge, I did do some changes and after compiling it worked. Why it worked I have no idea... 
 

## Changes are (if I remember correctly) the following :
 - Changed 'an Mastodon instance' to 'a Mastodon instance'
 - Changed the example instance from mastodon.social to niu.moe. Mastodon.social is cancer...
 - Added a line somewhere in either API.js or Mastodon.js that prints the client_id to the terminal. Note that it's already being printed to terminal so it's redundant. I just wanted to see if I can make a change to code that isn't responsible for the UI and see if it still worked.

 
Apart from that, I just compiled it and it worked. I'll upload the RPM I compiled to github too so it's available...
